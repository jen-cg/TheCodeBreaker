# The Code Breaker

Welcome to The Code Breaker a classic cryptography Python project

### What is a code / cipher ?
A code or cipher is an algorithm for encrypting / decrypting a piece of information.   
Encrypted information is, theoretically, unreadable to anyone expect a person who knows how to decrypt it.

Classic ciphers are encryption / decryption algorithms that were invented up until around the middle of the twentieth century.
Ciphers created after around the middle of the twentieth century form the basis of modern cryptography (the thing that makes secure digital communication possible!).  


### What is a cryptography?
Cyprtography is the study of techiques used to encrypt / decrypt information


### What is "The Code Breaker"
A fun Python project which demonstrates how to encrypt, decrypt, and break several classic ciphers. 

In doing so this project covers topics in coding, mathematics, and lingiustics.
