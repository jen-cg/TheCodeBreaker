DEAR B

YOU CAN ADD THIS TO YOUR PILE OF \"JUST IN CASE\" LETTERS. IF YOU GET TO READ IT THEN I SUSPECT IT WILL RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERS AND HOPEFULLY I WILL BE AROUND TO ANSWER THEM.

IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN YOU WON’T EVEN OPEN THIS, AND THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR US ALL, ESPECIALLY FOR JODIE.

I AM WRITING THIS SO IT CAN BE USED AS EVIDENCE IN THE HOPE IT WON’T COME TO THAT. AT THE END OF THE LIGHTHOUSE CONSPIRACY INVESTIGATION I TOLD YOU THAT JODIE HAD REQUESTED EXTENDED LEAVE AFTER A HARD CASE, BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE. SHE DISAPPEARED LEAVING ME A NOTE SUGGESTING THAT SHE HAD JOINED THE CONSPIRACY. I HAVE LEFT MY NOTES FROM THE END OF THE INVESTIGATION IN THE CASE FILES IN CASE THEY HELP.

WHEN I REALISED THAT SHE WASN’T COMING BACK I TRACKED HER TO DELHI WHERE I FOUND A TROVE OF PAPERS EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT THE GROUP, AND THAT RELIEVED SOME OF MY ANXIETY, BUT NOT ALL. A ROGUE AGENT IS NEVER A GOOD THING WHATEVER THEIR MOTIVATION.

I ASKED A FEW FRIENDS TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR JODIE AND AT LAST I THINK I MAY HAVE PICKED UP HER TRAIL. A COLLEAGUE IN THE US INTERCEPTED THE ATTACHED LETTER WHICH I AM PRETTY SURE WAS ADDRESSED TO HER. MS CIFRAR IS JUST THE SORT OF ALIBI SHE WOULD USE AND THIS IS THE SORT OF CASE I CAN IMAGINE HER WORKING ON.

I WILL HEAD OVER TO THE US TO SEE IF I CAN TRACK HER DOWN. IF I AM SUCCESSFUL AND CAN PERSUADE HER TO RETURN, THEN YOU WON’T GET TO READ THIS JOURNAL. IF I FAIL THEN I GUESS WE HAVE SOME DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS AHEAD.

VERY BEST WISHES,

HARRY
